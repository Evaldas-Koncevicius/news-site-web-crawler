Dev gets 4 years for creating kill switch on ex-employer's systems,Dev gets 4 years for creating kill switch on ex-employer's systems,"

A software developer has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his ex-employer's Windows network with custom malware and a kill switch that locked out employees when his account was disabled.

Davis Lu, 55, a Chinese national living legally in Houston, worked for an Ohio-based company, reportedly Eaton Corporation, from 2007 until his termination in 2019.

After a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, the DOJ says that Lu retaliated by embedding malicious code throughout the company's Windows production environment.

The malicious code included an infinite Java thread loop designed to overwhelm servers and crash production systems.

Lu also created a kill switch named ""IsDLEnabledinAD"" (""Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory"") that would automatically lock all users out of their accounts if his account was disabled in Active Directory.

When his employment was terminated on September 9, 2019, and his account disabled, the kill switch activated, causing thousands of users to be locked out of their systems.

""The defendant breached his employer’s trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti.

When he was instructed to return his laptop, Lu reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files.

Lu was found guilty earlier this year of intentionally causing damage to protected computers. After his four-year sentence, Lu will also serve three years of supervised release following his prison term."
Colt confirms customer data stolen as Warlock ransomware auctions files,Colt confirms customer data stolen as Warlock ransomware auctions files,"

UK-based telecommunications company Colt Technology Services confirms that customer documentation was stolen as Warlock ransomware gang auctions files.

The British telecommunications and network services provider previously disclosed it suffered an attack on August 12, but this is the first time they confirmed data had been stolen.

""A criminal group has accessed certain files from our systems that may contain information related to our customers and posted the document titles on the dark web,"" reads an updated security incident advisory on Colt's site.

""We understand that this is concerning for you.""

""Customers are able to request a list of filenames posted on the dark web from the dedicated call centre.""

As first spotted by cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont, Colt added the no-index HTML meta tag to the web page, making it so it won't be indexed by search engines.

This statement comes after the Warlock Group began selling on the Ramp cybercrime forum what they claim is 1 million documents stolen from Colt. The documents are being sold for $200,000 and allegedly contain financial information, network architecture data, and customer information.

BleepingComputer can confirm that the Tox ID listed in the forum post matches an ID used in earlier versions of the ransomware gang's ransom notes.

The Warlock Group (aka Storm-2603) is a ransomware gang attributed to Chinese threat actors who utilize the leaked LockBit Windows and Babuk VMware ESXi encryptors in attacks.

When the ransomware gang launched in March 2025, they used LockBit ransomware notes in their attacks, customized to include a Tox ID for ransom negotiations.

In June, the ransomware gang branded itself as the ""Warlock Group,"" with customized ransom notes and dark web negotiation and data leak sites.

Last month, Microsoft reported that the threat actors were exploiting a SharePoint vulnerability to breach corporate networks and deploy ransomware.

In negotiations seen by BleepingComputer, the ransomware gang demands ransom ranging between $450,000 and millions of dollars."
"Europol confirms $50,000 Qilin ransomware reward is fake","Europol confirms $50,000 Qilin ransomware reward is fake","

Europol has confirmed that a Telegram channel impersonating the agency and offering a $50,000 reward for information on two Qilin ransomware administrators is fake. The impostor later admitted it was created to troll researchers and journalists.

""We were also surprised to see this story gaining traction,"" Europol told BleepingComputer on Monday. ""The announcement didn't come from us.""

The statement comes after a new Telegram channel called @europolcti was created on August 16th, claiming to offer a $50,000 reward for information on two Qilin ransomware admins known as ""Haise"" and ""XORacle"".

""During the course of ongoing international investigations, we have confirmed that the cybercriminal group Qilin has carried out ransomware attacks worldwide, severely disrupting critical infrastructure and causing significant financial losses,"" reads the imposter's Telegram post.

""We have identified two primary administrators operating under the aliases Haise and XORacle, who coordinate affiliates and oversee extortion activities.""

""We are actively pursuing all available leads in cooperation with international partners.""

""A reward of up to $50,000 is offered for information that directly leads to the identification or location of these administrators.""

Haise is believed to be one of the operators of the Qilian ransomware gang, previously recruiting affiliates on the RAMP cybercrime forum.

The Qilin ransomware operation was initially launched as ""Agenda"" in August 2022. However, by September that year, it had rebranded under the name Qilin, which it continues to use to this day.

The ransomware operation is one of the most active, currently targeting companies worldwide.

However, after Europol confirmed it was fake, a new post appeared on the imposter channel claiming it was created to troll researchers and journalists, some of whom wrote articles about the claims.

""This was so easy to run and fool so called 'Researchers' and 'Journalists' that just copy stuff.. Thank you all!,"" reads the new post.

The post was signed by Rey, a hacker previously linked to breaches at Telefonica and Orange Group.

Threat actors had begun trolling Qilin in August 15th posts on a Telegram channel set up by threat actors claiming to be from ""Scattered Spider"", ""ShinyHunters"", and ""Lapsus,"" where someone had begun calling out Haise and the ransomware operation.

This is not the first time threat actors attempted to mislead the media about cybercrime.

In 2021, a RAMP admin known as 'Orange' or 'boriselcin' and who ran the ""Groove"" ransomware site, called on threat actors to attack the USA. This threat actor was later sanctioned by the US for his involvement in three ransomware operations that targeted victims across the United States.

After the media covered this post, including BleepingComputer, the threat actor claimed it was fake and was created to troll and manipulate the media and security researchers.

However, security researchers from McAfee and Intel 471 believe that it was likely the threat actor trying to cover up for a failed ransomware-as-a-service.

In 2023, BleepingComputer receieved a ""tip"" about an alleged arrest of two Canadian teens over a crypto-theft attack.

While BleepingComputer learned that the news was fake and did not cover the story, we were told it was done to manipulate the media and ""troll"" the people accused of the theft."
Microsoft asks customers for feedback on reported SSD failures,Microsoft asks customers for feedback on reported SSD failures,"

​Microsoft is seeking further information from customers who reported failure and data corruption issues affecting their solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) after installing the August 2025 security update.

Microsoft told BleepingComputer on Wednesday that it is aware of reports that installing the KB5063878 security update is causing SSD and HDD data corruption and failure issues.

In a service alert seen by BleepingComputer, the company added that it couldn't reproduce the issue on up-to-date Windows 11 24H2 systems and is now attempting to collect user reports with additional information from those affected.

""We are actively working with our storage device partners to try to reproduce the issue. At the time of this publication, neither internal testing nor telemetry have identified an increase in disk failure or file corruption,"" the company said.

""In addition, Microsoft customer support teams haven't received reports of customers experiencing this issue. If you are experiencing this issue, please contact Support for Business or use the Feedback Hub to file a report.

The company is also investigating if this issue is Microsoft's fault and has promised to provide an update when more details are available.

Reportedly impacts multiple SSD and HDD models

This issue was first reported last week by a Japanese PC builder who saw SSDs disappear from the OS during heavy write operations (like writing large files or many files at once) to drives that were over 60% full on devices with the KB5062660 preview update or this month's Windows 11 24H2 security update installed.

Other users have encountered the same issue on systems with Corsair Force MP600, Maxio SSD, SanDisk Extreme Pro, Kioxia Exceria Plus G4, Kioxia M.2, and various other drives with Phison and InnoGrit controllers.

A spokesperson for NAND controller maker Phison also shared a statement with BleepingComputer on Wednesday, saying that the company is ""working with Microsoft to resolve the issue.""

""Phison has recently been made aware of the industry-wide effects of the 'KB5063878' and 'KB5062660' updates on Windows 11 that potentially impacted several storage devices, including some supported by Phison,"" a Phison spokesperson told BleepingComputer.

""We understand the disruption this may have caused and promptly engaged industry stakeholders. [..] At this time, the controllers that may have been affected are under review and we are working with partners.""

Until the issue is addressed, Windows users should avoid writing large files (tens of gigabytes) and extract large compressed files with many items (e.g., 200 files of 200 MB each) in several steps rather than all at once."
Why Certified VMware Pros Are Driving the Future of IT,Why Certified VMware Pros Are Driving the Future of IT,"By Brenda Emerson, VMUG President

IT isn't getting any simpler. For many, the cloud’s gone hybrid, AI’s moved in permanently, and security threats seem to evolve faster than the tech built to stop them.

But what’s at the forefront of all of this? People.

The IT teams configuring, troubleshooting, deploying, and defending. And the IT staff that take the extra step to get certified are becoming some of the most valuable assets in modern enterprise.

The Certification Advantage: It's More Than a LinkedIn Update

There was a time when a VMware certification looked nice on a resume. Now? It’s a powerful differentiator for both the individual and the organization that backs them.

VMware certifications aren’t about memorizing trivia—they’re about proving capability, clarity, and consistency. Certified professionals don’t guess their way through a workload migration or a network segmentation plan. They execute with purpose. When I’m leading my team through tough calls, I rely on that expertise to help make smart decisions.

Hackers and security risks aren’t slowing down, but neither is my team. It’s my job to ensure they have the muscle-memory and expertise to use every part of our VMware ecosystem to solve these threats in real-time.



Why Smart Teams Are Getting Certified Together

This isn’t just about additional skills for a few team members. More and more tech leaders are going big and certifying entire teams.

Why? Because when everyone speaks the same technical language, innovation doesn’t get stalled at the handoff.

It builds empowered teams which are critical as you’re navigating complex IT and security issues.

Team-wide certification doesn’t just make your environment more resilient; it makes your talent more loyal, more tuned-in and better prepared to handle the threats to their ecosystems.

FBI warns of Russian hackers exploiting 7-year-old Cisco flaw,FBI warns of Russian hackers exploiting 7-year-old Cisco flaw,"

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned that hackers linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) are targeting critical infrastructure organizations in attacks exploiting a 7-year-old vulnerability in Cisco devices.

The FBI's public service announcement states that the state-backed hacking group, linked to the FSB's Center 16 unit and tracked as Berserk Bear (also known as Blue Kraken, Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, and Koala Team), has been targeting Cisco networking devices using CVE-2018-0171 exploits to breach organizations worldwide.

Successful exploitation of CVE-2018-0171, a critical vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software, can allow unauthenticated threat actors to remotely trigger a reload of unpatched devices, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or enabling the attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted device.

""In the past year, the FBI detected the actors collecting configuration files for thousands of networking devices associated with US entities across critical infrastructure sectors. On some vulnerable devices, the actors modified configuration files to enable unauthorized access to those devices,"" the FBI said.

""The actors used the unauthorized access to conduct reconnaissance in the victim networks, which revealed their interest in protocols and applications commonly associated with industrial control systems.""

The same hacking group has previously targeted the networks of US state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) government organizations and aviation entities over the last decade.

Admins urged to patch as soon as possible

Cisco, which first detected attacks targeting the CVE-2018-0171 flaw in November 2021, updated its advisory on Wednesday, urging administrators to secure their devices against ongoing attacks as soon as possible.

Cisco Talos, the company's cybersecurity division, said that the Russian threat group it tracks as Static Tundra has been aggressively exploiting CVE-2018-0171 in this campaign to compromise unpatched devices belonging to telecommunications, higher education, and manufacturing organizations across North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.

The attackers were also observed using custom SNMP tooling that enables them to gain persistence on compromised devices and evade detection for years, as well as the SYNful Knock firmware implant, first spotted in 2015 by FireEye.

""The threat extends beyond Russia's operations — other state-sponsored actors are likely conducting similar network device compromise campaigns, making comprehensive patching and security hardening critical for all organizations,"" Cisco Talos added.

""Threat actors will continue to abuse devices which remain unpatched and have Smart Install enabled."""
Scattered Spider hacker gets sentenced to 10 years in prison,Scattered Spider hacker gets sentenced to 10 years in prison,"

Noah Michael Urban, a key member of the Scattered Spider cybercrime collective, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy in April.

He was arrested in January 2024, and in November, the U.S. Justice Department charged Urban (also known as King Bob, Gustavo Fring, Elijah, and Sosa), along with four other suspects linked to the same financially motivated cybercrime group. The charges included wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

According to court documents, they were able to steal millions from cryptocurrency wallets between September 2021 and April 2023, using credentials stolen in SMS phishing attacks targeting dozens of individuals and companies.

They also used credentials stolen from hacked companies' employees to loot confidential data, including databases, personal identifying information, as well as ""confidential work product, intellectual property"" from their systems.

All this stolen information was later used to hijack victims' email accounts in SIM swap attacks, allowing them to gain control of their phone numbers and cryptocurrency wallets to transfer millions to wallets under their control.

From August 2022 to March 2023, Urban stole cryptocurrency from at least 59 victims in the U.S. after hacking their cryptocurrency accounts using information obtained in SIM swap attacks. While searching Urban's residence, the FBI discovered cryptocurrency worth approximately $4.8 million from victims' stolen accounts on his devices, and estimated the total loss to the victims to be over $13 million.

In a May 2023 interview with investigators, Urban stated that he had made ""several million dollars"" from cryptocurrency theft between January 2021 and March 2023, in addition to being involved in the theft of several million more, adding he still had a few million left after losing most of his earnings on gambling sites.

As News4Jax first reported, Urban received a 120-month prison sentence, despite prosecutors having only requested eight years, and will also be required to pay $13 million in restitution to the victims.

When investigative journalist Brian Krebs contacted Urban on Twitter after the sentencing, Urban responded from a county jail in Florida, stating that he believed the sentence was unjust. He argued that the judge had not considered his age as a mitigating factor because another Scattered Spider member had hacked the judge during the case.

The Scattered Spider cybercrime collective

Scattered Spider (also tracked as 0ktapus, Scatter Swine, UNC3944, and Muddled Libra, among others) is a fluid collective of threat actors known for sophisticated social engineering attacks targeting high-profile organizations worldwide and for using a wide range of tactics, including phishing, SIM swapping, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) bombing.

Their attacks escalated in September 2023, when they breached MGM Resorts and encrypted more than 100 VMware ESXi hypervisors using BlackCat ransomware after gaining access by impersonating an employee.

In some cases, Scattered Spider members have also partnered with ransomware operations, such as Qilin, RansomHub, and DragonForce.

High-profile organizations targeted by Scattered Spider in recent years include Twilio, Coinbase, DoorDash, Caesars, MailChimp, Riot Games, and Reddit. More recently, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting retail and insurance companies to the aviation and transportation industries.

U.K. police arrested another member of Scattered Spider in July 2024, a 17-year-old suspect believed to have been involved in the 2023 MGM Resorts ransomware attack. In December 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another teenager (a 19-year-old known online as ""remi"" also linked to Scattered Spider), charging him with breaching a U.S. financial institution and two unnamed telecommunications firms."
"Orange Belgium discloses data breach impacting 850,000 customers","Orange Belgium discloses data breach impacting 850,000 customers","

Orange Belgium, a subsidiary of telecommunications giant Orange Group, disclosed on Wednesday that attackers who breached its systems in July have stolen the data of approximately 850,000 customers.

Orange Belgium provides fixed and mobile connectivity services to over 3 million customers in Belgium and Luxembourg, employs 1,500 staff, and claims to operate the largest 4G/5G network in the country. Last year, the company reported total service revenues of €1.34 billion.

When BleepingComputer reached out on Wednesday for more details regarding last month's breach, an Orange Belgium spokesperson stated that the company couldn't confirm whether any systems were encrypted during the incident, but said that the breach wasn't the result of attacks targeting telecom companies worldwide that have been linked to China's Salt Typhoon cyber-espionage group.

The spokesperson added that Orange Belgium is aware of the threat group behind the breach, but didn't name them due to an ongoing investigation.

""At the end of July, Orange Belgium detected a cyberattack on one of its IT systems, resulting in unauthorised access to certain data from 850,000 customer accounts,"" the telecom company revealed.

While the threat actors didn't gain access to the passwords, email addresses, or financial information of impacted customers, they were able to compromise systems containing some account information.

""However, the hacker gained access to one of our IT systems containing the following data: surname, first name, telephone number, SIM card number, PUK code, tariff plan,"" it added.

Orange Belgium is notifying all customers affected by this incident via email or SMS, advising them to remain vigilant for any suspicious messages or calls because fraudsters could use the stolen information to impersonate Orange or another company and trick them into sharing other sensitive data like passwords and banking information.""

BleepingComputer was also told that this breach is a separate incident from the cyberattack disclosed by Orange Group at the end of July, when its parent company announced that it had detected a breached system on its network on July 25.

The Orange Group breach in July led to some operational disruptions, but they primarily affected French customers.

In February, Orange's Romanian branch also confirmed the breach of a non-critical application after a threat actor claimed to have stolen thousands of internal documents, containing 380,000 email addresses, as well as employee data, user records, source code, invoices, and contracts.

Five years ago, in early July 2020, the telecom giant's Orange Business Solutions division was also hit by a Nefilim ransomware attack, which exposed the data of twenty of its enterprise customers.

Orange Group, the parent company of Orange Belgium, has 125,800 employees worldwide and reported revenues of €40.3 billion in 2024. It provides communication and business services to 294 million customers across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including 256 million mobile and 22 million fixed broadband customers."
OpenAI says GPT-6 is coming and it'll be better than GPT-5 (obviously),OpenAI says GPT-6 is coming and it'll be better than GPT-5 (obviously),"

OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman told reporters that GPT-6 is already in the works, and it’ll not take as long as GPT-5.

The GPT-6 announcement doesn't surprise me because OpenAI is slowly becoming a product-first company rather than research-focused.

There's no denying that OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman overhyped GPT-5 and underdelivered.

While GPT-5 isn't exactly bad and actually offers significant improvements over GPT-4 or o3 for coding, the rollout wasn't smooth and some people were expecting more than gradual improvements.

OpenAI CEO believes the company will do better next time and GPT-5 wasn't really as bad some people claimed.

“I like the new one much better,” Altman told reporters last week.

""OpenAI quietly pushed a tone update to GPT-5 that’s 'much warmer.'""

OpenAI admitted that the GPT-5 rollout wasn’t really well thought out, but that won't stop the company from releasing GPT-6.

Sam added that GPT-6 will be bigger and different, but that's not the only product coming from OpenAI.



For example, OpenAI is testing improvements for voice mode and will allow you to customize the speed.

OpenAI is also testing a new version of Codex that will allow you to enable Code Review for all PRs."
AI website builder Lovable increasingly abused for malicious activity,AI website builder Lovable increasingly abused for malicious activity,"

Cybercriminals are increasingly abusing the AI-powered Lovable website creation and hosting platform to generate phishing pages, malware-dropping portals, and various fraudulent websites.

The malicious sites created through the platform impersonate large and recognizable brands, and feature traffic filtering systems like CAPTCHA to keep bots out.

While Lovable has taken steps to better protect its platform from abuse, as AI-powered site generators increase in number, the barrier to entering cybercrime continues to drop.

Lovable-powered campaigns

Since February, cybersecurity company Proofpoint ""observed tens of thousands of Lovable URLs"" that were delivered in email messages and were flagged as threats.

In a report today, the researchers describe four malicious campaigns that abused the Lovable AI website builder.

One example is a large-scale operation that relied on the phishing-as-a-service platform known as Tycoon. Emails contained Lovable-hosted links that opened with a CAPTCHA and then redirected users to fake Microsoft login pages featuring Azure AD or Okta branding.

These sites harvested user credentials, multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens, and session cookies through adversary-in-the-middle techniques. During the campaigns, the threat actor sent hundreds of thousands of messages to 5,000 organizations.

A second example was a payment and data theft campaign that impersonated UPS, sending nearly 3,500 phishing emails with links that directed victims to phishing sites.

The sites asked visitors to enter personal details, credit card numbers, and SMS codes, which were then sent to a Telegram channel controlled by the attacker.

The third is a cryptocurrency theft campaign that impersonated the DeFi platform Aave, sending out close to 10,000 emails via SendGrid.

Targeted users were led to Lovable-generated redirects and phishing pages designed to trick them into connecting their wallets, likely followed by asset drainage.

The fourth case concerns a malware delivery campaign distributing the remote access trojan zgRAT.

Emails contained links that led to Lovable apps posing as invoice portals, which delivered RAR archives hosted on Dropbox.

The files included a legitimate signed executable alongside a trojanized DLL that launched DOILoader, ultimately loading zgRAT.

Responding to the abuse

Lovable introduced real-time detection of malicious site creation in July, and also automatically scans published projects daily to spot and delete any fraud attempts.

The developer also stated that it plans to introduce additional protections this fall, which would proactively identify and block abusive accounts on the platform.

Guardio Labs confirmed to BleepingComputer that Lovable can still be used to create malicious sites. In a recent test, the researchers generated a fraudulent site to impersonate a large retailer and encountered no objection from the platform.

In a statement to BleepingComputer, Lovable says that their current strategy is to detect, prevent, and respond to cybercriminal efforts to create malicious apps or sites before they reach a wide audience.

The company said that it implemented an AI-powered safety program to help with enforcing policies, block projects that violate policies.

""Our support and safety team is always on watch. In the past two weeks alone, they’ve taken down over 300 sites that violated our policies,"" the company told BleepingComputer.

A Lovable representative also said that the current system blocks around 1,000 unique projects that violate the platform's rules, and that ""Lovable will not tolerate illegal or malicious content.""

Update [August 21]: We included a statement Lovable sent to BleepingComputer.

Apple fixes new zero-day flaw exploited in targeted attacks,Apple fixes new zero-day flaw exploited in targeted attacks,"

Apple has released emergency updates to patch another zero-day vulnerability that was exploited in an ""extremely sophisticated attack.""

Tracked as CVE-2025-43300, this security flaw is caused by an out-of-bounds write weakness discovered by Apple security researchers in the Image I/O framework, which enables applications to read and write most image file formats.

An out-of-bounds write occurs when attackers successfully exploit such vulnerabilities by supplying input to a program, causing it to write data outside the allocated memory buffer, which can lead to the program crashing, corrupting data, or, in the worst-case scenario, allowing remote code execution.

""Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,"" the company revealed in security advisories issued on Wednesday.

""An out-of-bounds write issue was addressed with improved bounds checking. Processing a malicious image file may result in memory corruption.""

Apple has addressed this issue with improved bounds checking to prevent exploitation in iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 17.7.10, macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.8, and macOS Ventura 13.7.8.

The complete list of devices impacted by this zero-day vulnerability is extensive, as the bug impacts both older and newer models, including:

iPhone XS and later,

iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation,

and Macs running macOS Sequoia, Sonoma, and Ventura.

The company has yet to attribute the discovery to one of its researchers and has not yet published details regarding the attacks it described as ""extremely sophisticated.""

While this flaw is likely only exploited in highly targeted attacks, it is strongly advised to install today's security updates promptly to prevent any potential ongoing attacks.

With this vulnerability, Apple has fixed a total of six zero-days exploited in the wild since the start of the year, the first in January (CVE-2025-24085), the second in February (CVE-2025-24200), a third in March (CVE-2025-24201), and two more in April (CVE-2025-31200 and CVE-2025-31201).

In 2024, the company has patched six other actively exploited zero-days: one in January, two in March, a fourth in May, and two others in November."
"“Rapper Bot” malware seized, alleged developer identified and charged","“Rapper Bot” malware seized, alleged developer identified and charged","

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against the alleged developer and administrator of the ""Rapper Bot"" DDoS-for-hire botnet.

Ethan Foltz, 22, of Eugene, Oregon, allegedly rented the botnet to cybercriminals eho targeted various organizations.

The botnet operation itself was seized as part of ‘Operation PowerOff ‘on August 6, during a raid at Foltz’s residence in Oregon.

The Mirai-based malware botnet, which is also known as “Eleven Eleven” and “CowBot,” has been active since at least 2021 and infected tens of thousands of Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and router devices.

The firepower ranged between 2 to 6 Tbps (terabits per second).

The U.S. DoJ announcement explains that Rapper Bot was used to target over 18,000 entities across 80 countries, including U.S. government systems, major media platforms, gaming companies, and large tech firms.

In 2023, Rapper Bot added a cryptomining module to diversify its revenue stream and maximize profits from compromised devices.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), which helped with tracing Rapper Bot's command and control infrastructure and assisted U.S. law enforcement with actionable intelligence, reports that since April 2025, Rapper Bot launched 370,000 attacks.

These attacks ranged from several terabits to over 1 billion packets per second (pps), with the power coming from more than 45,000 compromised devices across 39 countries.

Even they last a short period, the attacks can cost victims thousands of US dollars, says the DoJ, and extortion is often involved.

“The criminal complaint details that a DDoS attack averaging over two Terabits per second lasting 30 seconds might cost a victim anywhere from $500 to $10,000,” explained the DoJ.

“It is also alleged that some Rapper Bot customers used extortion demands, leveraging the DDoS attack volumes of the Botnet to extort victims.”

Foltz was charged with aiding and abetting computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of up to ten years in prison if convicted.

Currently, though, Foltz remains free. He was issued a summons following the filing of the criminal complaint.

The Rapper Bot has not shown any signs of resurgence in malicious activity following the seizure of its infrastructure by the authorities on August 6, so the existence of backup C2s controlled by other operators seems unlikely at this point."
Perplexity’s Comet AI browser tricked into buying fake items online,Perplexity’s Comet AI browser tricked into buying fake items online,"

A study looking into agentic AI browsers has found that these emerging tools are vulnerable to both new and old schemes that could make them interact with malicious pages and prompts.

Agentic AI browsers can autonomously browse, shop, and manage various online tasks (like handling email, booking tickets, filing forms, or controlling accounts).

Perplexity’s Comet is currently the primary example of agentic AI browsers. Microsoft Edge is also embedding agentic browsing features through a Copilot integration, and OpenAI is currently developing its own platform codenamed ‘Aura’.

Although these tools are currently aimed at tech enthusiasts and early adopters, Comet is quickly penetrating the mainstream consumer market.

According to an examination focused primarily on Comet, these tools were released with inadequate security safeguards against known and novel attacks specifically crafted to target them.

Tests from Guardio, a developer of browser extensions that protect against online threats (identity theft, phishing, malware), revealed that agentic AI browsers are vulnerable to phishing, prompt injection, and purchasing from fake shops.

In one test, Guardio asked Comet to buy an Apple watch while on a fake Walmart site the researchers created using the Lovable service.

Although in the experiment Comet was directed to the fake shop, in a real-life scenario an AI agent can end up in the same situation through SEO poisoning and malvertising.

The model scanned the site without confirming its legitimacy, navigated to checkout, and autofilled the data for the credit card and address, completing the purchase without asking for human confirmation.

In the second test, Guardio crafted a fake Wells Fargo email sent from a ProtonMail address, linking to a real, live phishing page.

Comet treated the incoming communication as a genuine instruction from the bank, clicked the phishing link, loaded the fake Wells Fargo login page, and prompted the user to enter their credentials.

Finally, Guardio tested a prompt injection scenario where they used a fake CAPTCHA page hiding instructions for the AI agent embedded in its source code.

Comet interpreted the hidden instructions as valid commands and clicked the ‘CAPTCHA’ button, triggering a malicious file download.

Guardio underlines that their tests barely scratch the surface of the security complexities that arise from the emergence of agentic AI browsers, as new threats are expected to replace the standard human-centric attack models.

“In the AI-vs-AI era, scammers don’t need to trick millions of different people; they only need to break one AI model,” Guardio says.

“Once they succeed, the same exploit can be scaled endlessly. And because they have access to the same models, they can “train” their malicious AI against the victim’s AI until the scam works flawlessly.”

Until the security aspect of agentic AI browsers reaches a certain level of maturity, it would be advisable that sensitive tasks like banking, shopping, or accessing email accounts are not assigned to them.

Also, users should avoid giving AI agents credentials, financial details, or personal information, and instead input that data manually when needed, which can act as a final confirmation step."
Hackers steal Microsoft logins using legitimate ADFS redirects,Hackers steal Microsoft logins using legitimate ADFS redirects,"

Hackers are using a novel technique that combines legitimate office.com links with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to redirect users to a phishing page that steals Microsoft 365 logins.

The method lets attackers bypass traditional URL-based detection and the multi-factor authentication process by leveraging a trusted domain on Microsoft's infrastructure for the initial redirect.

Legitimacy of a trusted redirect

Researchers at Push Security, a company that provides protection solutions against identity-based attacks, analyzed a recent campaign that targeted several of its customers and redirected employees from a legitimate outlook.office.com link to a phishing website.

While the phishing page did not exhibit any special elements that would prevent its detection, the delivery method utilized trusted infrastructure to evade triggering security agents.

Push Security determined that the phishing attack started with the target clicking a malicious sponsored link in Google search results for Office 265 (likely a typo).

Clicking the malicious result would direct the target to Microsoft’s Office, which in turn redirected to another domain, bluegraintours[.]com, that further redirected to a phishing page set up to collect credentials.

At first glance, getting to the malicious page appeared to have happened as a redirect from Microsoft’s office.com domain with no phishing email being involved.

When investigating the incidents, Push Security researchers discovered that “the attacker had set up a custom Microsoft tenant with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) configured.”

ADFS is a single sign-on (SSO) solution from Microsoft that allows users to access multiple applications, both inside and outside the corporate network, using a single set of login credentials.

Although the service continues to be available on Windows Server 2025 and there are no official plans to deprecate it, Microsoft has been encouraging customers to migrate to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access management (IAM).

By controlling a Microsoft tenant, the attacker was able to use ADFS to receive authorization requests from the bluegraintours domain, which acted as an IAM provider, to allow authentication on the phishing page.

Because the bluegraintours site is invisible to the target during the redirect chain, the attacker filled it with fake blog posts and sufficient details to make it appear legitimate to automated scanners.

Further analysis of the attack revealed that the threat actor implemented conditional loading restrictions that give access to the phishing page only to targets deemed valid.

If a user does not meet the conditions, they are automatically redirected to the legitimate office.com site, researchers say.

Jacques Louw, co-founder and Chief Product Officer at Push Security, told BleepingComputer that these attacks do not appear to target a specific industry or job roles, and may be the result of a threat actor's experimenting with new attack methods.

""From what we've seen this appears to be a group experimenting with novel techniques to get users to click highly trusted links to fairly standard phishing kits - in the same vein as groups like Shiny Hunters and Scattered Spider have been seen doing"" - Jacques Louw, co-founder and CPO at Push Security

Microsoft ADFS has been used in phishing campaigns before but attackers spoofed the targeted organization's ADFS login page to steal credentials.

To protect against this type of attacks, Push Security recommends a set of measures that include monitoring for ADFS redirects to malicious locations.

Since the investigated attack started from malvertising, the researchers also advise enterprises to check for ad parameters in Google redirects to office.com, as this may reveal malicious domains or redirects to phishing pages."
Major password managers can leak logins in clickjacking attacks,Major password managers can leak logins in clickjacking attacks,"

Six major password managers with tens of millions of users are currently vulnerable to unpatched clickjacking flaws that could allow attackers to steal account credentials, 2FA codes, and credit card details.

Threat actors could exploit the security issues when victims visit a malicious page or websites vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning, where attackers overlay invisible HTML elements over the password manager interface.

While users believe they are interacting with harmless clickable elements, they trigger autofill actions that leak sensitive information.

The flaws were presented during the recent DEF CON 33 hacker conference by independent researcher Marek Tóth. Researchers at cybersecurity company Socket later verified the findings and helped inform impacted vendors and coordinate public disclosure.

The researcher tested his attack on certain versions of 1Password, Bitwarden, Enpass, iCloud Passwords, LastPass, and LogMeOnce, and found that all their browser-based variants could leak sensitive info under certain scenarios.

Exploitation methods

The main attack mechanic is to run a script on a malicious or compromised website that uses opacity settings, overlays, or pointer-event tricks to hide the autofill dropdown menu of a browser-based password manager.

The attacker then overlays fake intrusive elements (e.g. cookie banners, popups, or CAPTCHA) so that the user’s clicks fall on the hidden password manager controls, resulting in completing the forms with sensitive information.

Tóth demonstrated multiple DOM-based subtypes that constitute exploitation variants of the same flaw, including direct DOM element opacity manipulation, root element opacity manipulation, parent element opacity manipulation, and partial or full overlaying.

The researcher also demonstrated the possibility of using a method where the UI follows the mouse cursor, so any user click, no matter where it’s positioned, triggers data autofill.

Tóth says that a universal attack script can be used to identify the password manager active on the target’s browser and then adapt the attack in real-time.

Vendor impact and responses

The researcher tested 11 password managers chosen for their popularity and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one attack method.

The researcher notified all vendors notified of the issues in April 2025. The researcher also alerted them that public disclosure would follow in August at DEF CON 33.

Socket performed another round of contacts this week to notify them that theyr are filing CVEs for their respective products.

1Password categorized the researcher's report as “out-of-scope/informative,” arguing that clickjacking is a general web risk users should mitigate.

Similarly, LastPass marked the report as “informative,” while Bitwarden acknowledged the issues but downplayed the severity. However, Bitwarden told BleepingComputer that the issues have been fixed in version 2025.8.0, rolling out this week.

LogMeOnce did not respond to any communication attempts, either by Tóth or Socket.

Currently, the following password managers, which together have around 40 million users, are vulnerable to Tóth's attack methods

1Password 8.11.4.27

Bitwarden 2025.7.0

Enpass 6.11.6 (partial fix implemented in 6.11.4.2)

iCloud Passwords 3.1.25

LastPass 4.146.3

LogMeOnce 7.12.4

The vendors that implemented fixes are Dashlane (v6.2531.1 released on August 1), NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, and Keeper (v17.2.0 released in July). However, users should make sure that they're running the latest available versions of the products.

Until fixes become available, Tóth recommends that users disable the autofill function in their password managers and only use copy/paste.

BleepingComputer has contacted all vendors who haven’t pushed fixes onto their products yet, and we will update this post with their responses once they reach us.

[Update 8/20 3:20 PM EST] - LastPass and LogMeOnce reached out to BleepingComputer following the publication of this article to explain that they too are working on resolving the issues raised in Tóth's report.

[Update 8/20 3:40 PM EST] - Edited the vendor notification timeline for better accuracy, based on new information received from Socket.

[Update 8/20 4:15 PM EST] - LastPass sent BleepingComputer the following statement:

""We appreciate the work of security researchers, like Marek Tóth, who help raise awareness about potential threats and improve industry-wide security. The clickjacking vulnerability Marek uncovered highlights a broader challenge facing all password managers: striking the right balance between user experience and convenience, while also addressing evolving threat models.

LastPass has implemented certain clickjacking safeguards, including a pop-up notification that appears before auto-filling credit cards and personal details on all sites, and we’re committed to exploring ways to further protect users while continuing to preserve the experience our customers expect.

In the meantime, our threat intelligence, mitigation and escalation (TIME) team encourages all users of password managers to remain vigilant, avoid interacting with suspicious overlays or pop-ups, and keep their LastPass extensions up to date."" - Alex Cox, Director Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, Escalation (TIME) at LastPass.

[Update 8/21 3:40 AM EST] - 1Password sent BleepingComputer the following comment:

""Clickjacking is not unique to the 1Password browser extension. It is a long-standing web attack technique that affects websites and browser extensions broadly. Because the underlying issue lies in the way browsers render webpages, we believe there’s no comprehensive technical fix that browser extensions can deliver on their own.

We take this and all security concerns seriously, and our approach to this particular risk is to focus on giving customers more control. 1Password already requires confirmation before autofilling payment information, and in our next release, we’re extending that protection so users can choose to enable confirmation alerts for other types of data. This helps users stay informed when autofill is happening and in control of their data."" - Jacob DePriest, CISO at 1Password

[Update 8/23] - LogMeOnce informed BleepingComputer that they just released an update addressing the clickjacking issues."
